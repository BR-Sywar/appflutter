As part of my internship at Technopole Ecopark, I developed a photovoltaic monitoring system aimed at optimizing solar energy facility operations. The system leveraged Raspberry Pi to retrieve real-time data from various machine types, enabling accurate performance tracking. I designed an interactive mobile app dashboard to visualize this data, providing users with real-time insights into system health. Additionally, I implemented a warning and notification system to promptly alert users to any issues, reducing response times and minimizing downtime. This project effectively reduced monitoring costs while improving the overall management of solar energy performance.
